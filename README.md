Babby and Home Monitoring Mount
I had Craig design this for me (and the world). It fits a Raspberry Pi Zero and the Pimoroni Nightvision camera.

It was placed on the wall in Emmy's room with a Command Strip and it's been there for the better part of two years.

Craig did an amazing job with this. Here's his original note:


```
I'm Craig Noneofyourbusiness
jk, Craig Ester, and I was told by Dave, presumably the guy
you got this most awesome of 3D-printable baby monitor CAD
files from, to write this. If you didn't, well, that's the 
internet.

If you liked the cad work or and want help with something,
or perhaps you just want to say hi to the most random of 
rando internet strangers, please email me at the following
email address.

NOTE: Do not send unsolicited mail, I only want legitimate
questions, thanks, or basically anything that's not some
scammer trying to convince me that microsoft has a room
like the war room in Dr. Strangelove where they can see
every windows machine and MINE has 3*10^8 viruses.
In all seriousnes, no unsolicited contact. Only those who
seek the wisdom of Craig.

Your email may go into my junk folder or I may not have
read it in a timely manner, please give me two days then
resend whatever you sent.
